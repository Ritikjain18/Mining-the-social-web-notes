##Chapter 1. Mining Twitter

-Twitter might be described as a real time, highly social microblogging service that allows users to post short status updates, called tweets, that appear on timelines.

-In addition to the textual content of a tweet itself, tweets come bundled with two additional pieces of metadata that are of particular note:entities and places. 

- Tweets entities are essentially the user mentions,hashtags,URLs, and media that may be associated with a tweet, and places are locations in the real world that may be attached to a tweet.
